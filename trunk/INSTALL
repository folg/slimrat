Arch Linux
----------

You can install Slimrat from AUR:
  - stable version: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=20499
  - SVN version: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=29697



Gentoo
------

1) Install Layman

Run the following commands (If layman is not already installed)
   echo "app-portage/layman git subversion" >> /etc/portage/package.use
   emerge layman

NOTE: Only run the first command, if the git use flag is not enabled.
      The subversion use flag is also recommended for layman. You can remove
      it if subversion is not needed.


2) Add the Custom Overlay

Open /etc/layman/layman.cfg, and find the line that says
   overlays  : http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/layman-global.txt"
Add "http://belak.sbboard.com/gentoo/overlay.xml"
Sample code:
   overlays  : http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/layman-global.txt
	          http://belak.sbboard.com/gentoo/overlay.xml

Run the following commands as root (using either sudo or su)
   layman -S
   layman -a belak.gentoo


3) Install slimrat

NOTE: For the first command, you may use ** in place of ~x86 to use
the "hard mask", which draws files right from the repositories. This
does require subversion. A hard mask will not update automaticly.
   echo "net-misc/slimrat ~x86" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
   emerge slimrat

NOTE: Overlays will not update themselves. You must run layman -S,
      along with emerge --sync to update all ebuilds, then run your update



PLD linux
---------

Currently no prebuilt RPM package is available, but the projects
CVS repository contains a SPEC file to generate one.

1) Initialise the folder structure

Do this by issuing the command
   builder --init-rpm-dir

After that, enter the "rpm" directory at your home folder.


2) Download the spec file from the CVS repository into "~/rpm/SPECS"

You can find the spec file at the following url:
    http://cvs.pld-linux.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/packages/slimrat/

Currently the spec file does not require any other files from the
CVS repository, but this could change with time. You might need to
check out more files from that location.


3) Build the RMP

Execute the next command to build a binary RPM:
   ./builder -bb -bc -R foo


4) Install the resulting RPM



Other RPM-based distro's
------------------

RPMs (though currently outdated) are available at:

  - WWW::Mechanize
  - Gtk2::GladeXML (GUI)
  - Gtk2::SimpleList (GUI)
  - Spiffy (GUI)

a) On Debian/Ubuntu
      aptitude install libwww-mechanize-perl
      aptitude install libgtk2-gladexml-perl xclip libspiffy-perl # (GUI)
      
b) On FreeBSD
      portinstall -Pp ftp/wget devel/p5-Getopt-Long devel/p5-Term-ANSIColor x11-toolkits/p5-Gtk2 x11-toolkits/p5-Gtk2-GladeXML x11-toolkits/p5-Gtk2-Ex-Simple-List www/p5-LWP-UserAgent-Determined www/p5-WWW-Mechanize
      
c) Manually (through CPAN)
      perl -MCPAN -e 'install Getopt::Long, LWP::UserAgent, Term::ANSIColor, WWW::Mechanize';
      perl -MCPAN -e 'install Gtk2::GladeXML, Gtk2::SimpleList, Spiffy'; # (GUI)


2) Installation

Unpack the tarball at a place you want to. Users wanting to run slimrat do not
need to have write access to that folder.
   tar -xjvf slimrat-x.x.x.tar.bz2 -C /usr/local/bin/

Create symlinks to the main slimrat executables.
   ln -s /Path/to/SlimRat/slimrat /usr/local/bin/slimrat
   ln -s /Path/to/SlimRat/slimrat-gui /usr/local/bin/slimrat-gui

Optional: create a system-wide configuration file at /etc/slimrat.conf, a sample
          configuration file documenting all options is provided under the name "slimrat.conf"
