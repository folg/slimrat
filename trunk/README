Release notes
-------------

1) Home directory

Slimrat now (by default) uses "~/.slimrat" as a home directory,
and creates that file automatically when absent. Older versions
however used the file "~/.slimrat" to save certain settings to. When
creating the home directory, slimrat shall check whether there is
such a file, and will in that case get renamed to ".slimrat_old".


2) Queue file

The queue file, by default "~/.slimrat/queue", has a similar problem:
as its file format has changed over the releases, slimrat might once
complain about it not being readable. You might want to backup that
file (which on older releases contains readable URLs), because slimrat
shall overwrite it each time when closing down with the new Queue contents



Installation
------------

See the INSTALL file for a detailled guide on how to install
slimrat.
