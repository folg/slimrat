# GENERAL #

# VERSION SPECIFIC #

* 0.9.6
  - Make every plugin fetch the primary page once, maybe @ constructor
  - Split `slimrat` into `slimrat-cli` and `slimrat-common.pm`, and make `slimrat-gui` use those
    common methods instead of invoking `slimrat(-cli)`
  - Implement some "save queue" and "load queue" methods in Queue.pm, which should take care of
    manually added URLs as well as loaded file queue's.
  - Support for loading a specific configuration file through parameters
  - Statusbar
  - Handle debug messages before log initialisation somehow (e.g. amount of plugins loaded)
  - Log::dump($info, $data), upon plugin error dump all -> tar.bz if --debug, upload for help
