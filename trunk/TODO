    common methods instead of invoking `slimrat(-cli)`

    manually added URLs as well as loaded file queue's.
  - Support for loading a specific configuration file through parameters
  - Statusbar
  - Use ~/.slimrat/log for all output, unless overriden to /var/log/. Also always log everything.
  - Implement variables in configuration parsing, including "~" for home and $error for post_failure
    (same with ./)
