# GENERAL #
  - add links to running instance
    slimrat --add --list list.txt http://link/1 http://link/2

  - make it possible to download more links at same time (every one from different site)

# VERSION SPECIFIC #

* 1.0
  - Handle debug messages before log initialisation somehow (e.g. amount of plugins loaded)
  - Limit maximum download speed
  - Test everything!
  - Test everything again ;)
  - Make use of the Queue structure in slimrat-gui. Currently the Queue structure is very sequential,
    which makes it hard to use in the GUI (contrary to its use in the cli). Maybe rewrite the Queue
    with random access in mind?
  - Captcha preprocessing: now download() gets captcha reader pointer, if plugin provides captcha_preprocess_ocr
    function, the captcha reader preprocesses the captcha, then to ocr. if fail, complete captcha to user.
