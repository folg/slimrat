# GENERAL #
  - add links to running instance
    slimrat --add --list list.txt http://link/1 http://link/2
  - GUI: notifications Gtk2::Notify?
  - INTERFACES:
    * cli
    * gui
    * web
    * ncurses
    * jabber
  - Statusbar: does not seem to be threadsafe.
    Testcase: check group of links, then check a single one.
    threads->create call blocks when statusbar enabled (really...)
  - Merge all retry code of the download() call, at it's all the same
    More generally: make that code clean, it's a mess...
  - Improve resuming, JDownloader seems capable to resume all download
    providers (Megaupload, Rapidshare, ...)
  - Download speed indication in GUI (blocker: statusbar)
  - Rework the filename fetching, as some download provides doesn't display
    the actual filename in the statuspage, but only upon final request.
    How to handle resuming then?
  - LottaNZB style progress indication
