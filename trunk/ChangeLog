    * Toolbox (dwait): fixed reference to ptime().
    
    * slimrat: added function prototypes, and enhanced the command-
      line options handline.
    
    * slimrat: enhanced backgrounding support, through a state file
      to save the PID of the daemon in, and a killswitch to kill a
      single running instance.

    * slimrat: use a hash in combinaton with GetOptions instead
      of several global variables.
    
    * queue: added POD documentation.
    
    * log: added POD documentation, and replaced some more raw prints
      with routines from log package.

    * log: added controllable verbosity level, through --verbose
      and --quiet parameters.

    * queue: converted the datastructure so it properly
      supports a get() call to get the current URL, and
      an advance() call to proceed to the next URL (which
      possibly reads from a file, skipping commented out or
      already processed links). Fixes issue 30.
      This makes a $status=0 (from the check() function each
      plugin should implement) value relevant: it indicates
      a temporary failure, so the link doesn't get commented
      out but ignored so it can get retried upon a new session.
    
    * ChangeLog: added a requested changelog with most prominent
    changes. To be kept up to date from now on.


2009-05-20  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * log: introduced a helper library to ease logging. It
      provides several functions (debug, info, warning, error,
      fatal) to differentiate the message. The message is
      coloured depending to the message level, but verbosity
      settings have yet to be implemented.

    * plugins: added OdSiebie and HotFile plugins.
    
    * all: relicensed to MIT-license.
