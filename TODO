# GENERAL #
  - add links to running instance
    slimrat --add --list list.txt http://link/1 http://link/2
  - update the wiki's Readme/Install/... and link them from trunk to /wiki

# VERSION SPECIFIC #

* 1.0
  - Test everything!
  - Test everything again ;)
  - Make use of the Queue structure in slimrat-gui. Currently the Queue structure is very sequential,
    which makes it hard to use in the GUI (contrary to its use in the cli). Maybe rewrite the Queue
    with random access in mind?
  - Rotate log?
