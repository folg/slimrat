# VERSION SPECIFIC #

* 1.0
  - Test everything!
  - Remove 'this is a development release' message ;)
  - Set update server correctly to 'tags'
  - Make sure all plugins use $self->{PRIMARY|MECH} properly, e.g.
    get_data must support being called multiple times (in which case
    a problem arises when the plugin uses $self->{MECH} after it has
    been navigated away from the primary page. Maybe ditch the {PRIMARY}
    usage in get_data and re-fetch the primary URL into $self->{MECH}?
