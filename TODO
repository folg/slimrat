# VERSION SPECIFIC #

* 0.9.6
  - Replace `wget` by pure-perl solution (LWP)
  - Split `slimrat` into `slimrat-cli` and `slimrat-common.pm`, and make `slimrat-gui` use those
    common methods instead of invoking `slimrat(-cli)`
  - Implement some "save queue" and "load queue" methods in Queue.pm, which should take care of
    manually added URLs as well as loaded file queue's.
  - Support for loading a specific configuration file through parameters
  - Statusbar
  - Use ~/.slimrat/log for all output, unless overriden to /var/log/. Also always log everything.
