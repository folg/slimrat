2009-07-18  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * configuration (save): suppot for saving values back into
      a configuration file.

    * log (dump_*): framework to generate and save dump files,
      very handy to debug issues.

    * log (dump_*): finetuned the dumping process, and added
      some sample dumps in all plugins.

    * log: several simplifications.


2009-07-17  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * mediafire: fixed issue 44 - MediaFire plugin


2009-07-16  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * plugin (new): abandoned eval structure, using dynamic
      binding (fixes issue 32).

    * Direct: should be manually enabled now.

    * configuration (init): parent object gets appropriately altered
      upon initialisation of a configuration entry in a
      subsection.

    * log: support for log and screen output, and some basic
      possibilities to configure the verbosity and type of
      output to both of them.

    * configuration (file_read): substitute negatively connoted
      values by a 0.

    * plugins: cleaner plugin configuration, passed through
      construction to make certain checks possible as early as
      possible (e.g. if we can use the Direct plugin, issue 31).

    * configuration: simplified it a bit, removing multiple values
      per key and some other fancy stuff.


2009-07-15  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * configuration (file_read, section, merge): implemented
      support for sections (indicated by "[\w+]"), extracting
      them from the main configuration object, and merging them
      back in an object with default values (see documentation).

    * configuration: removed any dependancy to other custom
      packages, making it usable all over the place.
    
    * toolbox, plugins: moved dwait() to log, to remove the
      dependancy.

    * slimrat: removed wget references.

    * slimrat (daemonize): stricter daemonization, disallowing
      multiple instances and dying upon failure to write the state
      file.

    * slimrat: moved output configuration as high up as possible,
      and altered sample configuration file.

    * slimrat, plugins: support for per-plugin configuration section.

2009-07-01  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * slimrat: fixed issue 35, by creating a .slimrat folder
      at runtime and moving inclusions of custom packages.

      instance.


2009-06-29  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * slimrat: moved all colour dependant functions (check and
      download summary) to the Log.pm module.

    * slimrat: removed the wget dependancy, using a pure-Perl
      solution now (LWP-based downloader). The plugin model has
      also altered a lot, with the possibility to support
      several protocols and enhanced requests.

    * plugins: ported to the new plugin framework, implementing
      additional get_filename and get_size methods where
      possible.


2009-06-27  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * slimrat: initial switch to LWP, only porting the Direct
      plugin for now.


2009-06-19  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * slimrat-gui: refactored the code, and ported some parts
      to the configuration handler.

    * slimrat: added documentation, and used Pod::Usage to
      generate a --help and --man dialog based on that
      documentation.
    
    * log (usage): added a new reporting function which
      indicates invalid usage.


2009-06-18  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * configuration: removed the revert() functionality, but
      added support for a key with multiple values.


2009-06-17  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * slimrat: implemented the use of the brand new configuration
      handler.

    * configuration (file_read): implemented configuration
      file parsing, with support for mutable as well as
      immutable entries.

    * configuration: fixed some bugs with the struct handling,
      and made use of the configuration handler on some places
      in the main slimrat executable.


2009-06-16  Přemek Vyhnal  <premysl.vyhnal gmail com>

    * plugins: added UploadedTo.


2009-06-16  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * Toolbox (dwait): fixed reference to ptime().

    * slimrat: added function prototypes, and enhanced the command-
      line options handline.

    * slimrat: enhanced backgrounding support, through a state file
      to save the PID of the daemon in, and a killswitch to kill a
      single running instance.

    * Config: added the initial functions for a class which will ease
      the handling of configurations, originating from different sources
      across the system.


2009-06-09  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * slimrat: use a hash in combinaton with GetOptions instead
      of several global variables.

    * queue: added POD documentation.

    * log: added POD documentation, and replaced some more raw prints
      with routines from log package.


2009-06-04  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * log: added controllable verbosity level, through --verbose
      and --quiet parameters.

    * queue: converted the datastructure so it properly
      supports a get() call to get the current URL, and
      an advance() call to proceed to the next URL (which
      possibly reads from a file, skipping commented out or
      already processed links). Fixes issue 30.
      This makes a $status=0 (from the check() function each
      plugin should implement) value relevant: it indicates
      a temporary failure, so the link doesn't get commented
      out but ignored so it can get retried upon a new session.

    * ChangeLog: added a requested changelog with most prominent
    changes. To be kept up to date from now on.


2009-05-20  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * log: introduced a helper library to ease logging. It
      provides several functions (debug, info, warning, error,
      fatal) to differentiate the message. The message is
      coloured depending to the message level, but verbosity
      settings have yet to be implemented.

    * plugins: added OdSiebie and HotFile plugins.

    * all: relicensed to MIT-license.


2009-05-19  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * plugins: added EasyShare plugin.


2009-05-18  Přemek Vyhnal  <premysl.vyhnal gmail com>

2009-05-17  Přemek Vyhnal  <premysl.vyhnal gmail com>

    * plugins: added Data.hu plugin.

    * slimrat: added custom commands to execute pre-download, and
      upon failure or completion.


2009-05-17  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * slimrat: added backgrounding capabilities.

    * plugins/Rapidshare: added interval-check.

    * slimrat: support for comments in the link file.

    * slimrat: downloaded links get comments out upon completion.
