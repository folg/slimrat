2009-06-19  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * slimrat-gui: refactored the code, and ported some parts
      to the configuration handler.

    * slimrat: added documentation, and used Pod::Usage to
      generate a --help and --man dialog based on that
      documentation.
    
    * log (usage): added a new reporting function which
      indicates invalid usage.


2009-06-18  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * configuration: removed the revert() functionality, but
      added support for a key with multiple values.

      handler.

2009-06-16  Přemek Vyhnal  <premysl.vyhnal gmail com>

    * plugins: added UploadedTo.


2009-06-16  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * Toolbox (dwait): fixed reference to ptime().

    * slimrat: added function prototypes, and enhanced the command-
      line options handline.

    * slimrat: enhanced backgrounding support, through a state file
      to save the PID of the daemon in, and a killswitch to kill a
      single running instance.

    * Config: added the initial functions for a class which will ease
      the handling of configurations, originating from different sources
      across the system.


2009-06-09  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * slimrat: use a hash in combinaton with GetOptions instead
      of several global variables.

    * queue: added POD documentation.

    * log: added POD documentation, and replaced some more raw prints
      with routines from log package.


2009-06-04  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * log: added controllable verbosity level, through --verbose
      and --quiet parameters.

    * queue: converted the datastructure so it properly
      supports a get() call to get the current URL, and
      an advance() call to proceed to the next URL (which
      possibly reads from a file, skipping commented out or
      already processed links). Fixes issue 30.
      This makes a $status=0 (from the check() function each
      plugin should implement) value relevant: it indicates
      a temporary failure, so the link doesn't get commented
      out but ignored so it can get retried upon a new session.

    * ChangeLog: added a requested changelog with most prominent
    changes. To be kept up to date from now on.


2009-05-20  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * log: introduced a helper library to ease logging. It
      provides several functions (debug, info, warning, error,
      fatal) to differentiate the message. The message is
      coloured depending to the message level, but verbosity
      settings have yet to be implemented.

    * plugins: added OdSiebie and HotFile plugins.

    * all: relicensed to MIT-license.


2009-05-19  Tim Besard  <tim-dot-besard-at-gmail-dot-com>

    * slimrat: added custom commands to execute pre-download, and
      upon failure or completion.
